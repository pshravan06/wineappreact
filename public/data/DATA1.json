A bright & fresh take on a traditional Paloma with Milagro Reposado.Inspired by the upbeat energy and creativity of Mexico City, Milagro Tequila is hand-crafted in a process where tradition meets innovation. Our agave is sourced in the Jalisco Highlands, where the finest, sweetest blue agave in the world is cultivated. To extract all of the nuances of the precious agave flavor, the agave pias are slow-roasted for 36 hours in traditional brick ovens. The extracted juice is then fermented and is finally distilled twice: first, in a pot still to retain the vibrant and mouthwatering flavors of the agave and second, in a column still to impart an absolutely exquisite smoothness that compares to the finest white spirits in the world. Please enjoy Milagro Tequila responsibly.","field4":"Milagro","field5":"57.99","field6":"Milagro","field7":"1.75","field8":"L","field9":"Mexico"}

The January rains left good moisture in the soil for the vines to begin the growing season with early bud-break; canopy growth was rapid and even. Additional rainfall in March and April supported the later vine growth as well.

At the age of sixteen, he started work in the Distillery as an office boy and fast became a leading pioneer in the development of bourbon. From the time he was made company president in 1921 until his retirement in 1952, his Distillery expanded from 44 to 144 buildings to become the largest Distillery of its day. During that period Colonel Blanton created his very special and limited supply of bourbon - his private reserve - handpicked and stored in what now is known as the famous Warehouse H. Although Colonel Blanton died in the spring of 1959, his legacy lives. Introduced in 1984, Blantons namesake bourbon was the first ever Single Barrel Bourbon sold commercially. The Single Barrel Bourbon is the first of its kind.Blanton's is the Original Single Barrel Bourbon that retains its uniqueness today by virtue of world wide critical acclaim. It has been awarded international gold medals, grand gold medals, and recommendations from noted spirits writers like Paul Pacult. The individual barrel selection process is one that involves one of the most respected Master Distillers in the bourbon industry. Elmer T. Lee introduced Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon in 1984 and since that time has been enshrined in the Master Distillers' Hall of Fame. Elmer searched the honey spots of Warehouse H to personally select those barrels destined for greatness. Unlike other brands which are restricted to certain ages, Blanton's strives for a distinctive flavor profile across an array of years. The typical bourbon used is approximately eight years old, however, it is not unusual for the age to extend to ten or twelve years. From world-class bourbon to the most unique package, everything about Blanton's exudes quality, class, and excellence.REVIEWS\"Liquid gold.\"Jim Murray's Whisky BibleTASTING NOTESA deep, satisfying nose of nutmeg and spices.

Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable just not in a predictable way.He wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.No rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.The result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.This collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.If you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.For your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan.

Our 86 proof whisky has the intense, full-bodied flavor reminiscent of a driftwood fire at dusk. The taste of dry peat smoke with strong maritime notes results in a complex dram that is complemented by a long, elegant finish. Distilled in Lagavulin, Scotland on the coast of Islay, centuries of local distilling excellence has earned our whisky the Double Gold Medal at the 2017 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Our aging process in oak casks gives our whisky the extraordinary and classic smoky flavor that demands to be served in a traditional whisky glass, neat or with a little water. Carrying on a 200-year-old tradition of distilling excellence, the Lagavulin distillery is said to be one of the oldest distilleries on Islay. Founded in 1816 by farmer John Johnston and later led by Peter Mackies in 1887, the name Lagavulin was to become the last word on the delicacy of Islay malts. Miles and miles of peat bog in the west of the island provide the raw material which imbues the barley with our iconic smoky flavor, and the rich peaty water that runs from the Solan Lochs into the distillery makes the flavors so unique.

Working conditions are much better than they used to be.
