# SweetOrDry App made with React.js


## Project Description: 
SweetOrDry is an app being built for a local liquor with the goal to make it easier for the store's employees to find the perfect bottle of wine for customers. With this app, conversions and customer satisfaction are expected to greatly increase. 

## App Function: 
Currently, the app can filter the liquor store's inventory by red and white wines. Features being added soon include the ability to
filter by wine taste (sweet,dry, sweet-dry), wine body (light,full), food pairings, etc. 

## How It Works:

The store's inventory excel sheet was converted to a JSON file (stored in "data" folder, file name "DATA1.json".

On loading, the app populates a table with data from the JSON file. This data includes name, description, company, price, country or origin, etc.

The data did not include details such as color, taste, etc. The algorithmic filtering was done through ".filter" algos all available in App.js.
